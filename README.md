Takibat
=======

***PLEASE NOTE I AM STILL WORKING ON THIS! IT'S NOT IN ANY STATE TO BE USED AT THE MOMENT***

A General-purpose IRC Bot that's designed to be easily extensable
for various uses. The original implementation was just a Python
bot that went to fetch live baseball scores (hence why it's
`Takibat` and not `Takibot`).

This iteration of code is based upon Java and Jython (Yes, I am a
programming redneck, shut up). The core bot (the part coded in
Java) handles the IRC Connection and functions such as
(re)loading Python Plugins and dispatching commands to the proper
Python File.
